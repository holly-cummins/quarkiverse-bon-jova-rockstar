Baby you'll come knockin' on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
I said ya...well...what am I supposed to do
I didn't know what I was gettin' into

So you had a little trouble in town
Now you're keepin' some demon down
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

It's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you've lost
This doesn't have to be the big "get even"
This doesn't have to be anything at all

I know you really want to
Tell me good-bye
I know you really want to
Be your own girl

Baby you could never look me in the eye
Yeah you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

There's people running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Than make a meal of some bright eyed kid
You need someone looking after you

I know you really want to
Tell me good-bye
I know you really want to
Be your own girl

Baby you could never look me in the eye
Yeah you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
