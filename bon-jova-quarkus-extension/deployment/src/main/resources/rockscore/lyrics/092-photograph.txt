Huh!

I'm outta luck, outta love
Got a photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free,
So far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

Photograph
I don't want your photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free
So far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

I gotta have your

Photograph
I don't want your photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph

You've gone straight to my head

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

I gotta have your
I gotta have your

Photograph
I don't want your photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph

I wanna touch you

Oh

I need more than your photograph
I'm outta love

I'm outta luck

You're the only one
Photograph
I wanna touch
