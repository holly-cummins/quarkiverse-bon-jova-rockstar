I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the crying that I do is for you

I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah

Without your love I'm nothing but a begger
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone
Baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby, baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my a-a-a-angel
Come and save me tonight (Angel)
You're my a-a-a-angel
Come and take me all right

Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
