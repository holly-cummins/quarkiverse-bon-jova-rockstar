Step inside, walk this way
You and me, babe
Hey, hey

Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon, get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man?
(Your man)

Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss Innocent, sugar me
Yeah
Yeah, uh, c'mon

Take a bottle
Shake it up
Break the bubble
Break it up

Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough

I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

Listen
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
Crazy little woman in a one-man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up (Loosen up)
Loosen up

You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little, tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss Innocent, sugar me
Yeah
Yeah, give a little more

Take a bottle
Shake it up
Break the bubble
Break it up

Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough

I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
Cause I'm hot (hot), so hot, sticky sweet
From my head, (head, head), my head to my feet

Do you take sugar?
One lump or two?

Take a bottle (Take a bottle)
Shake it up (Shake it up)
Break the bubble (Break it up)
Break it up

Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough

Pour some sugar on me
Oh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
Get it, come get it
Pour your sugar on me
Oh
Pour some sugar on me
Yeah, sugar me
