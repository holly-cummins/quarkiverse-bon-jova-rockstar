#### Introduction

[medium tab]
In our industry, we often use the term ‘rockstar developers’ for these incredibly high-peforming people. It’s a bit of a
problematic idea, because they may not necessarily have the best effect on the team overall, a bit too much ego and too
little collaboration.

[indeed tab]
But despite that, it’s a common phrase in recruiter adverts.

Eventually, someone got annoyed and suggested making a language called rockstar so anyone could be a Rockstar developer.

And then, because this is how geeks work, someone took that idea and implemented it.

“Rockstar is a computer programming language designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads.”

As a refresher on what hair metal is, it’s this.

[specs tab]
So although it’s totally ridiculous, there’s a whole spec, and it’s interesting and non-trivial. The programs, if
well-written, really do read like rock ballads, and they’re computationally expressive. But not concise.

[esoteric wikipedia tab]
I hadn’t known until I started researching it, but there’s a whole huge genre of these languages. “An esoteric
programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of
computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language
or as a joke”

Scroll down to Brainfuck and Chicken. Rockstar is a lot more readable than these, but maybe just as silly.

It’s also a great fit with Quarkus iconography.

So here’s the extension.
