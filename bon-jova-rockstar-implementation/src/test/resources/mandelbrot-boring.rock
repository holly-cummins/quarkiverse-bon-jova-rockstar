isInMandelbrotSet wants x, and y (function that decides if a point is in the set and returns a space or a dot)
    maxIterations is 320
    iterationCount is 0
    The hope is 0
    The fear is 4
    Let something be 0
    Let anything be 0
    While iterationCount is lower than maxIterations and the hope is lower than the fear
        Let love be something
        Let love be something of it (in other words, something times something, that is, squared)
        Let your head be anything
        Let your head be anything of it (in other words, anything times anything)
        Let the difference be love without your head (Bon Jova does not order operations using proper mathematical rules, so we need an interim value when chaining addition and subtraction)
        Let the summit be the difference plus x
        A million is insufficient (a fancy way of defining 2)
        Let product be a million times something times anything
        Let anything be product plus y (Bon Jova does not order operations using proper mathematical rules, so we need an interim value when chaining multiplication and addition)
        Let something be the summit
        Let the hope be something of something + anything of anything
        Build iterationCount up

    The world is only scared
    Cast the world into dot
    Happiness is a fire
    Let your need be the world without happiness
    Cast your need into blank (all of the above lines are very complicated way to generate two characters, done in a loop for extra inefficiency)
    If iterationCount is less than maxIterations
        Let the answer be blank,
    Else let the answer be dot

    Return the answer

calculateRow takes time
    Push row (Initialise the array before using it in a while loop, see https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-bon-jova-rockstar/issues/110)
    index is 0
    Knock index down, down (Decrement down to -2)
    Your dreams is 0.4
    Your spirit is 0.03
    While index is weaker than your dreams
    Let index be index with your spirit
    Let love be index
    Push row with isInMandelbrotSet taking love 'n' time

    Join row
    Return row

rowPos is impossible
Knock rowPos down (a complicated way of declaring -1)
Our souls are incredible
Build our souls up (a complicated way of declaring 1)
While rowPos are weaker than our souls
    The moon is a light
    Let rowPos be rowPos with our souls over the moon
    Say calculateRow taking rowPos
